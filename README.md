# Long-Term-Deposit-Prediction
The project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model using bank data to predict potential customers for long-term deposits. By having 84% accuracy in identifying these customers, the model will help optimize the efforts of frontline callers, reducing the need to contact the same individuals and enhancing overall efficiency repeatedly.
